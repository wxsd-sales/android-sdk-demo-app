# Android SDK Demo App
 Welcome to our WXSD DEMO Repo! <!-- Keep this here --> 
 
This demo provides an introduction on how to begin building Android applications with meetings, messaging and other basic features, using the Webex Android SDK.

In this application, we use the SDK to retrieve details about the logged in user, extract all the direct contacts of that user, and use messaging and meeting features to engage with their contacts. This application also demonstrates how to add meeting controls like muting the audio, muting the video, screen sharing, speaker mode, holding the call etc. You can also login and logout of the app using OAuth webview.
